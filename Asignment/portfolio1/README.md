# Portfolio 1

In this assignment you have to create: 
i) a document (e.g. gdoc, word, etc), and 
ii) a githubrepository.

In the document you need to
- describe 2 possible strategies to play the Matching Pennies Game.
- include a discussion as to whether they include "cognitive constraints", that is, for instance, a discussion of memory limits and their impact on the strategy, or other important cognitive science driven considerations.
- report the formalization of these strategies, that is, a diagram and/or lines of code implementing the strategy.
- include plots of how the strategies fare against each other (or other baselines), according to the instructions for the class in Week 3, and a very brief discussion of what the plots allow you to understand.ï‚§include a link to the GitHub repository
- The GitHub repository must be linked in the document and must include all the code for the strategy implementation, simulation of agents playing with those strategies and visualization of the plots
