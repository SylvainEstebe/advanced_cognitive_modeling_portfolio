# Overview
This repository contains the development and validation of a cognitive model for the Matching Pennies game using the Stan modeling language. The primary goal is to explore and document the behavior modeling process through a comprehensive analysis including parameter recovery and model quality assessments.

### Model Description
The Matching Pennies model implemented in this project is an conceptualization using an reinforcement learning based model tailored for understanding decision-making behaviors in a binary game context.
