# Overview
This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a formalized categorization model for the alien game, an exercise we engaged with during lectures. 
The project involves applying and modifying the Generalized Context Model (GCM) to simulate and evaluate categorization decisions based on the game's structure.

### Data Source
The dataset utilized here conceptualizes stimuli as five-dimensional vectors with binary values, representing different features of aliens.
A total of 32 unique stimuli are presented in randomized order across three sessions. Each stimulus is categorized on two dimensions: danger and nutrition.
